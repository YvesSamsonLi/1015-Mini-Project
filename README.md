Practical Motivation
According to the singapore heart foundation, cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) represents 32% of global deaths annually. Singapore has seen a increase of death due to cardiovascular disease as well. (Singapore Heart Foundation,2021)

It was found by the Centre of disease control and prevention that there are many factors as to why one may develop heart disease.

As a major health hazard to the population and something that can happen to anyone, we want to understand how other health factors as well as lifestyle habits might influence the risk of one getting heart disease.
